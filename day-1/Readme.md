# Day 1 – Logic Gates (8-Bit Computer Project)

This is **Day 1** of my **8-bit computer from scratch** project.

In this first day, I focused entirely on the **fundamental building blocks of digital systems**:  
👉 **Logic gates implemented at transistor level**

For each logic gate, I built and verified:
- The **real hardware implementation** using transistors
- The **electrical schematic**
- The **truth table**
- A **digital simulation** to validate the behavior

This step is essential before moving to more complex blocks like adders, registers, and control logic.

The following logic gates were implemented and tested:

- NOT
- BUFFER
- AND
- NAND
- OR
- NOR
- XOR
- XNOR

Each gate was tested in **all possible input states**, and the physical behavior was observed and documented.

### 🔹 NAND, NOR, XNOR Gates

These gates were derived and implemented using transistor-level logic.

For each gate:
- ✅ Full truth table verified
- ✅ All input states tested on real hardware
- ✅ Electrical schematic documented
